1. To build signal RL1(ESTOP) we need the RL5 - door switches but we haven't it.
2. After deleting the switch (F, p.2) isn't clear the connection RL6 - should be discussed with customer.
3. The power supply of the convertes of Breast Roll is controlled by it's own (RL9 - CON1, RL14 - CON2). Logic the energizing the relay isn't clear.
5. After deleting the switch (F, p.3) isn't clear the connection RL11 - should be discussed with customer.

Noticed to Casani sheme:
1. DRM04.A106.DI3 is the same as DRM04.A110.DI2, they could be Spared.
2. RL26 should be DO, but we have DI. 
3. Don't forget about F, p.8 and this two DO.

1. Please update the commentar to Mapping
2. To build Panel F-Supply we need sone feedback from power supply unit.
3. Don't forget about converters and their Relay in main sheme. RL4, RL14, RL9
4. Don't forget about tilt pot lamp to pulpit!
5. Don't forget send data from coverters to old PLC RL10 and others!
6. Don't forget about RL26, we have DI but should DO! Tilt Pot!
7. Don't forget about RL25 (earth fault) and RL20, converters!
