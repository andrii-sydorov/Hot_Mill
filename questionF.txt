1. To build signal RL1(ESTOP) we need the RL5 - door switches but we haven't it.
2. After deleting the switch (F, p.2) isn't clear the connection RL6 - should be discussed with customer.
3. The power supply of the convertes of Breast Roll is controlled by it's own (RL9 - CON1, RL14 - CON2). Logic the energizing the relay isn't clear.
5. After deleting the switch (F, p.3) isn't clear the connection RL11 - should be discussed with customer.

Noticed to Casani sheme:
1. DRM04.A106.DI3 is the same as DRM04.A110.DI2, they could be Spared.
2. RL26 should be DO, but we have DI. 
3. Don't forget about F, p.8 and this two DO.
