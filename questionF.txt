1. To build signal RL1(ESTOP) we need the RL5 - door switches but we haven't it.
2. After deleting the switch (F, p.2) isn't clear the connection RL26 - should be discussed with customer.
3. The power supply of the convertes of Breast Roll is controlled by it's own (RL9 - CON1, RL14 - CON2). Logic the energizing the relay isn't clear.
4. The signals that energized RL39 (F, p.3) aren't found - added in new Casani sheme - DRA
5. After deleting the switch (F, p.3) isn't clear the connection RL11 - should be discussed with customer.
6. The signals that energized RL13 (F, p.3)  (F68 ... F62) aren't found.
7. The using the contancts of RL13 (F, p.3)  aren't found.
8. The meaning the contacts on converter. RL15 (F, p.5)- Breast Roll2 Healthy, should be send to MES PLC (P, 16) - now is occupied by another signal.
9. We have the same signals twice F150 - F154 (Galich), 150 - 154 (Casani)... Which should we use?
10. In scheme of Casani he used DRM04.A109.DI1 and DRM04.A109.DI2  (p.36) but in old sheme this contsct aren't responding (F, p.6)
