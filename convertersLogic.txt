From the logic below this drive has setpoint from pulpit (manual mode) and system Maras(automatic), the purpose of C6 - C8 isn't clear, should be clarified! May be depends in the limit switch the part of ways work maras another part manual speed setpoint.

The logic isn't clear, it can has speedsetpoint linke from previous converter (where it could be Maras or from Pulpit) or direct from Pulpit, that's why is possible when two converters have the different setpoint first from Maras, second from Pulpit?
