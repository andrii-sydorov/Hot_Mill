Remarks

Panel F:
1. DRM04_Rev01.A106.DI1 it's our internal signal from panel C - could be Spared.
2. DRM04_Rev01.A106.DI3 and DRM04_Rev01.A110.DI2 it's our internal signal from panel D (the same in both cases) - that's why they could be spared.
3. DRM04_rev01.A108.DI1 it's out internal signal from panel C - could be Spared.
4. DRM04_Rev01.A108.DI2 - here we working with RL26, but RL26 should be digital output (F 6.5 and 7.4)
5. DRM04_Rev01.A108.DI3 - this signal we are taking from Galich sheme, that's why could be spared.
6. DRM04_Rev01.A109.DI3 and DRM04_Rev01.A110.DI2 - it's signal to start BreastRoll1 and BreastRoll2, but we are getting from one RL1 (panel P), that's why we need only one input. another could be spared.
7. DRM04_Rev01.A111.DI0 and DRM04_Rev01.A111.DI1 - this two signals should have another commentar, the correct version it's above on terminal box (at the this page).

Panel D:
1. DRA_Rev01.A103.DO2 - it's our internal signal, which we are sending to Panel F - that's why could be spared.
2. DRA_Rev01.A104.DO3 - it's signak to Start automatic mode, it should be DI, not DO.
3. DRA_Rev01.A113.DI2 and DRA_Rev01.A113.DI3 - they both shouls have another commentar (see the terminal above at this page).
