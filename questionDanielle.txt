////////////// General /////////////////
1. The meaning the terminal for building converter logic.
2. The feed back contacts from circuit breaker and contactor.
3. The safety logic and it's connection to PLC.

////////////// F ///////////////////////
1. Have we any door switches, like in previous sheme?
2. F, p.2 we haven't this switch, could it be replace via HMI or should be deleted completely?
3. The same question like in 2, but about Control Available Breast Roll2 - repalce via HMI?
4. For building the signal RL13 - F, p.3 we need the signal from LTAC and VOLMER and send data to VOLMER, but we haven't input and output for this.
5. F, p.8 the digital output isn't found! 

////////////// D ///////////////////////
1. We haven't output to build signal for "Power Supply Panel D" - D, p.1
2. Missed R3/SDC/1 to build RL3. Also should the switches replaced by HMI? D, p.2
3. Missed R3/TC/1 to build RL4. Also should the switches replaced by HMI? D, p.2
4. Switch CS2 the part of switch we have on the pulpit, another part not. D, p.2 - Pulpit, p.7 - Galich! 
5. The same question about door switches, do we need them? - D, p.3
6. The logic of building RL55 input signal RL8 isn't found! - D, p.4.
7. RL7 and others, everywhere where is MARAS, it's another separate System? We need any input for it's logic? D, p.5, D, p.7
8. Clutch contactor do we need it?
9. For speedsetpoint can we use HMI?
10. RL54 - Auto Relay how to build it? D, p.10.
11. TMC and MC Mode - difference.
12.  RL1 in building of RL43 input signal isn't found. D, p.14 - Galich!

////////////// C ///////////////////////
1. The switches should be implemented via HMI? Without them some Relays haven't any purpose. CS6, CS7 - C, p.2
2. Lamp should be implemented via HMI? C, p,2
3. Many signals from building the logic Rl6 and RL7 aren't found. C, p.2, but MC2 and MC1 - Millpulpit, p.9 - Galich
4. The output signal 1T ...  RL7A ... 111T - C, p.2
5. Internal EmergencyStop in building of RL9, 52NI_ILGNER_SET_CB C , p.3
6. MBRG isgnal is absent in logic of RL10 - C , p.3
7. The output contach of RL10A aren't found and data excahnge between Mill Motor and Generator and PLC - C ,p.4
8. Pulpit Emergency Stop - Galich! - C , p.5 many relays are absent. CS5 implemented over HMI? Door switches we allways.
9. The Mill overspeed signal we haven't, but Edger overspeed we have. C, p.6
10. Do we need speed setpoint via joystick? May be we should use HMI? For another mechanismus we have the joystick, but in new shema any. C, p.9 - IW1100 - Galich
11. Power circuit breaker for Mill and Edger, have we got them? C, p.11
12. Input or Output for the Tachogenerator? C, p.18 - QW1020.
13. Any input signal for the logic of RL34 - EBRG and PB2? C, p.20 - Galich?
14. Any output signals for RL34 and dataexchange between converters and MES-PLC. C, p.21
15. Edger overspeed we have this signal for Edger, but haven't for the Mill. C, p.22
16. In logic of RL82 we haven't K/S and EMBR. C, p.22
17. RL76 we haven't any reset button. C, p.22
18. RL50 CS1is absent, replace via HMI? C, p.32 To pay attnetion to Shear pullpit, p.2 - Galich!
19. Also for RL50 - LTAC O/P/S, page 5. 52NI - from p.361 (big circuit)
20. RL50A output signals and data excahnge between converters and MES PLC - C, p.33
21. The reason of all Stall should be clarified! C, p.34 - reset button.
22. The MB in logic of RL60 isn't found! - C, p.35
23. Emergency stop button should be updated anf RL63 output contact added. C, p.36
24.
